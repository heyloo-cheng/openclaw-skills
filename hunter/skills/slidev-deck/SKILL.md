# Slidev Deck

Generate complete, ready-to-present slide decks using sli.dev (Markdown-based presentations) with inline hand-drawn SVGs in the portfolio's sketchy style. Each deck tells a visual story -- SVGs carry the narrative, text stays minimal. Decks pull structured data from the hunter product-discovery pipeline and produce a single `slides.md` file runnable with `npx slidev`.

## Step 0: Load Conventions

Before doing ANYTHING, read the shared conventions file:

```
Read /Users/peleke/Documents/Projects/skills/skills/custom/_conventions.md
```

This file defines: canonical vault path, folder-to-type mapping, frontmatter contract, valid statuses, tag hierarchy, cross-reference syntax, and the PipelineEnvelope schema. All output from this skill MUST conform to those conventions. If there is a conflict between this SKILL.md and `_conventions.md`, the conventions file wins.

## When to Use

- Creating a pitch deck for external audiences (warm leads, partners, potential customers)
- Summarizing hunter pipeline validation results for internal review
- Presenting technical architecture to engineering audiences
- Building strategy decks for business positioning and revenue planning
- Any situation where a visual presentation needs to tell a product or engineering story

## Trigger Phrases

- "Build a pitch deck for [product]"
- "Create a validation summary deck from [pipeline outputs]"
- "Make a strategy presentation for [product/domain]"
- "Generate a technical architecture deck for [system]"
- "Slide deck for [topic]"
- "/slidev-deck [type] [product]"

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, establish:

1. **Deck type** -- One of: `product-pitch`, `validation-summary`, `technical-architecture`, `strategy` (see Deck Types below)
2. **Product/domain** -- What product, system, or domain the deck is about
3. **Audience** -- Who will see this (warm leads, investors, internal team, engineers, etc.)
4. **Pipeline data** -- Which pipeline outputs are available (signal scans, decisions, personas, offers, pitches). Glob the vault to find them:
   ```
   Glob: Admin/Product-Discovery/**/*.md
   ```
5. **Key message** -- The single sentence the audience should remember after the deck

If the user provides only a product name, ask about deck type, audience, and key message before proceeding. If pipeline data exists in the vault, load it automatically.

---

## SVG Style Contract

All SVGs in decks MUST follow the portfolio's dark-theme sketchy style. This is non-negotiable.

### Color Palette (Dark Slide Background)

| Role | Color | Hex |
|------|-------|-----|
| Slide background | GitHub dark | `#0d1117` |
| Primary text | Cream | `#eee0cc` |
| Accent (coral) | Warm coral | `#e88072` |
| Success (green) | Bright green | `#4ade80` |
| Danger (red) | Soft red | `#f87171` |
| Muted | Gray | `#888888` |
| Box fill | Translucent coral | `rgba(232,128,114,0.06)` |
| Highlighted box fill | Translucent coral (stronger) | `rgba(232,128,114,0.12)` |

### Font

```
font-family="'Caveat', 'Comic Sans MS', cursive"
```

- Titles: 20-24px, bold
- Labels: 14-16px
- Annotations: 11-13px
- Captions: 10-12px, muted (`#888888`), reduced opacity

### Sketchy Primitives

**Lines**: Never use `<line>`. Use `<path>` with cubic beziers and 1-3px jitter on control points.

```xml
<path d="M 50,51 C 90,48 130,53 170,49 C 210,52 240,48 250,51"
      stroke="#eee0cc" stroke-width="2" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round"/>
```

**Rectangles**: Never use `<rect>` for content boxes. Build from 4-segment `<path>` with jittered corners.

```xml
<path d="M 132,68 C 230,65 430,71 562,67
         C 565,85 563,105 565,128
         C 430,131 230,127 132,131
         C 129,113 131,87 129,68"
      stroke="#e88072" stroke-width="2" fill="rgba(232,128,114,0.06)"
      stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"/>
```

**Circles**: Use bezier-approximated circles, not `<circle>`, except for numbered callouts.

**Numbered callouts**: Coral fill circle with white bold number text.

```xml
<circle cx="108" cy="82" r="14" fill="#e88072" stroke="none" opacity="0.9"/>
<text x="108" y="87" text-anchor="middle"
      font-family="'Caveat', 'Comic Sans MS', cursive"
      font-size="14" fill="white" font-weight="bold">1</text>
```

**Arrows**: Bezier path body + marker-end arrowhead (or inline chevron path).

```xml
<defs>
  <marker id="arrow" viewBox="0 0 12 10" refX="10" refY="5"
          markerWidth="8" markerHeight="6" orient="auto-start-reverse"
          fill="none" stroke="#eee0cc" stroke-width="1.5"
          stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round">
    <path d="M 1,1 L 10,5 L 1,9"/>
  </marker>
</defs>
<path d="M 336,134 C 338,150 334,162 336,176"
      stroke="#eee0cc" stroke-width="2" fill="none"
      stroke-linecap="round" marker-end="url(#arrow)"/>
```

**Rotation**: Apply slight rotation transforms (0.3-1.2 degrees, alternating positive/negative) to element groups.

```xml
<g transform="rotate(-0.5, 336, 630)">
  <!-- content -->
</g>
```

**Filters**: Use roughen filter for organic texture, glow filter for accent elements.

```xml
<defs>
  <filter id="roughen" x="-2%" y="-2%" width="104%" height="104%">
    <feTurbulence type="turbulence" baseFrequency="0.03" numOctaves="2" result="noise" seed="5"/>
    <feDisplacementMap in="SourceGraphic" in2="noise" scale="1.2" xChannelSelector="R" yChannelSelector="G"/>
  </filter>
  <filter id="glow">
    <feGaussianBlur stdDeviation="3" result="blur"/>
    <feMerge><feMergeNode in="blur"/><feMergeNode in="SourceGraphic"/></feMerge>
  </filter>
</defs>
```

**Dashed connectors**: Use `stroke-dasharray="4 4"` or `stroke-dasharray="8 5"` for secondary/feedback paths.

**Underlines**: Sketchy path under headings, same color as heading, reduced opacity.

```xml
<path d="M 172,46 C 240,48 360,44 500,47"
      stroke="#e88072" stroke-width="1.5" fill="none"
      stroke-linecap="round" opacity="0.6"/>
```

### ViewBox Sizing

All SVGs use `viewBox` with no fixed `width`/`height` (responsive). Standard slide SVG viewBox: `0 0 672 400` (fits 16:9 slides). Adjust height as needed but keep width at 672 for consistency.

### SVG Checklist (per SVG)

- [ ] No fixed `width`/`height` on root `<svg>` -- only `viewBox`
- [ ] No clean `<rect>` for content boxes -- use sketchy `<path>`
- [ ] No clean `<line>` for visible strokes -- use sketchy `<path>`
- [ ] Uses `Caveat` font family with fallback stack
- [ ] Slight rotation on element groups (varied, not uniform)
- [ ] Colors from the dark palette only (`#eee0cc`, `#e88072`, `#4ade80`, `#f87171`, `#888888`)
- [ ] No background rect (transparent -- sits on dark slide background)
- [ ] Arrows use marker-end or inline chevron paths
- [ ] Roughen filter on organic elements
- [ ] Self-contained: no external dependencies

## Workflow

```
User request (deck type + product + audience)
    |
Phase 1: Gather pipeline data (glob vault, read artifacts)
    |
Phase 2: Map data to slide sequence (fill each slide's data fields)
    |
Phase 3: Generate SVGs (use sketches skill style, inline in markdown)
    |
Phase 4: Assemble slides.md (frontmatter + global styles + slides)
    |
Phase 5: Add speaker notes (every slide)
    |
Phase 6: Quality check (run checklist)
    |
Phase 7: Write Obsidian summary note
    |
Output: slides.md + Obsidian note
```

### Phase 1: Gather Pipeline Data

Glob the vault for all pipeline artifacts related to the product:

```
Glob: {vault}/Admin/Product-Discovery/**/{product-slug}*.md
Glob: {vault}/Admin/Product-Discovery/**/{product-slug}*.json
```

Read each artifact and extract the fields needed for the chosen deck type. If an artifact is missing, note which slides will have incomplete data and ask the user whether to proceed with what's available or wait.

### Phase 2: Map Data to Slides

For each slide in the chosen deck type's sequence, map specific pipeline data to the slide's content fields:

```
Slide N:
  - headline: [from which artifact, which field]
  - SVG description: [what to draw, what data to embed]
  - text content: [bullets, stats, quotes -- with source]
  - speaker notes: [context, evidence, talking points]
```

If a data point is not available from the pipeline, DO NOT fabricate it. Either skip the slide or mark it as "[DATA NEEDED: describe what's missing]".

### Phase 3: Generate SVGs

For each slide that needs an SVG, generate it inline following the SVG Style Contract above. Every SVG must:

1. Use the dark-theme palette (no light backgrounds)
2. Use sketchy primitives (no clean rects or lines)
3. Use Caveat font family
4. Have a `viewBox` of `0 0 672 NNN` (width 672, height varies)
5. Be self-contained (no external references)
6. Have NO background rect (transparent, sits on `#0d1117` slide background)

For complex SVGs (architecture diagrams, pipeline flows, competitive maps), use the `sketches` skill's technique reference:

```
Read /Users/peleke/Documents/Projects/skills/skills/custom/sketches/references/svg-patterns.md
```

Adapt the whiteboard palette patterns to the dark palette colors.

### Phase 4: Assemble slides.md

Combine all slides into a single `slides.md` file:

```md
---
theme: default
title: "DECK TITLE"
info: |
  DECK DESCRIPTION
class: text-white
drawings:
  persist: false
transition: fade-out
mdc: true
---

# Slide 1 Title

content

<style>/* GLOBAL STYLES -- only on first slide */</style>

---

# Slide 2 Title

content

---
layout: two-cols
---

# Slide 3 Left

::right::

Right content

---

<!-- ... remaining slides ... -->
```

Slides are separated by `---` on their own line. Layout directives go in the slide's frontmatter block (the `---` block at the top of each slide).

### Phase 5: Add Speaker Notes

Every slide MUST have speaker notes. Add them as HTML comments at the end of each slide:

```md
# Slide Title

content

<!--
Speaker notes here. These appear in presenter view.
- Key talking point 1
- Key talking point 2
- Data reference: [which pipeline artifact, which field]
-->
```

Speaker notes should:
- Provide context the slide doesn't show
- Include exact data references (which pipeline artifact, which field)
- Suggest transitions to the next slide
- Anticipate audience questions
- Never exceed 6 bullet points

### Phase 6: Quality Check

Run the full checklist (see Quality Checklist below) before delivering.

### Phase 7: Write Obsidian Summary Note

After generating the deck, write a summary note to the vault.

| `pitch` | `positioning` | Positioning Statement |
| `pitch` | `email_sequence` | (appendix if needed) |

### Missing Data Protocol

If a pipeline artifact is missing:

1. Check if the user has the raw data available elsewhere
2. If not, mark affected slides with `<!-- [DATA NEEDED: {artifact}.{field} -- run {skill-name} to generate] -->`
3. Generate the deck with placeholder SVGs showing "Data pending: run [skill name]" in muted text
4. List all missing artifacts in the Obsidian summary note
