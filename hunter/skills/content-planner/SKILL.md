# Content Planner

Generate a content plan from recent engineering work. Scan GitHub repos + buildlog entries, identify publishable narratives with fan-out opportunities, and output Obsidian-compatible markdown.

## Step 0: Load Conventions

Before doing ANYTHING, read the shared conventions file:

```
Read ${SKILLS_DIR}/_conventions.md
```

This file defines: canonical vault path, folder-to-type mapping, frontmatter contract, valid statuses, tag hierarchy, cross-reference syntax, and the PipelineEnvelope schema. All output from this skill MUST conform to those conventions. If there is a conflict between this SKILL.md and `_conventions.md`, the conventions file wins.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Scan Recent Activity + Buildlog

Run the Python scan script to collect GH data AND buildlog entries:

```bash
python3 ${SKILLS_DIR}/content-planner/scripts/scan_repos.py --days 14 --format summary
```

For JSON output (when you need structured data for processing):

```bash
python3 ${SKILLS_DIR}/content-planner/scripts/scan_repos.py --days 14 --format json
```

To scan specific repos only:

```bash
python3 ${SKILLS_DIR}/content-planner/scripts/scan_repos.py --days 14 --repos "/path/to/repo1,/path/to/repo2"
```

Key repos to always scan (in priority order):
1. `qortex-track-c` — core engine
2. `buildlog-template` — dev workflow tool
3. `openclaw` — AI agent platform
4. `interlinear` — language learning app
5. `MindMirror` — health/wellness
6. `langchain-qortex`, `mastra-qortex` — consumer packages

The scan script automatically collects:
- **GitHub**: merged PRs, open issues, recent commits
- **Buildlog entries**: title, sections, commits, word count, depth classification
- **Fan-out analysis**: which content types each entry can generate
- **Metadata**: review learnings, promoted skills, reward events

### Step 2: Read Deep Buildlog Entries

The scan script classifies entries by depth:
- **deep** (800+ words): Full narrative entries. Read these in full — they're gold mines.
- **medium** (300-800 words): Solid entries. Read selectively based on fan-out score.
- **shallow** (<300 words): Quick commit logs. Skim for context, don't build content from these alone.

For each **deep** and high-fanout **medium** entry, read the full file:

```
Read {entry.file}
```

When reading, extract:
1. **The narrative arc**: Goal → Obstacle → Resolution → Insight
2. **Concrete artifacts**: commit hashes, test counts, code snippets, error messages
3. **Quotable moments**: "what went wrong" stories, unexpected discoveries, aha moments
4. **Cross-references**: PR/issue links, other repos mentioned, buildlog entries that connect

### Step 3: Fan-Out Analysis

Each buildlog entry can generate **multiple** content pieces. The scan script tags fan-out opportunities automatically:

| Entry Section | Content Type | Channel | Example |
|---------------|-------------|---------|---------|
| The Goal / Context | **Provocation** | LinkedIn | "Nobody's doing X. Here's what that costs." |
| Architecture / Components | **Architecture** | Blog | "Here's why we chose X over Y." |
| The Journey / What Went Wrong | **Build Log** | Substack | "I shipped X in Y days. Here's how." |
| Improvements / Lessons | **Lessons** | LinkedIn | "I learned X the hard way. Save yourself the trip." |
| Test Results / Benchmarks | **Results** | Blog | "We measured X. The data says Y." |

**Fan-out scoring**:
- `fanout_count >= 4`: High-value entry. Plan 3-5 content pieces from it.
- `fanout_count 2-3`: Medium. Plan 1-2 pieces.
- `fanout_count 0-1`: Low. Combine with other entries or skip.

**Cross-entry fan-out**: Look for entries across repos that tell a connected story. Example:
- qortex "Mnemosyne Phase 1" + buildlog "Rule-Level Attribution" → Series: "Teaching Your AI to Learn"

### Step 4: Identify Content Opportunities

For each repo's recent activity + buildlog entries, identify narratives in these categories:

| Category | What to Look For | Audience |
|----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Provocation** | Gaps you found in the industry. Claims nobody else is making. | LinkedIn + blog |
| **Architecture** | Novel technical decisions. Why X not Y. The tradeoff. | Blog (technical) |
| **Build Log** | Velocity stories. "Here's what I shipped and how." | Substack + blog |
| **Tutorial** | Something you built that others could learn from. | Blog + HN |
| **Results** | Data. Measurements. Before/after. Convergence curves. | Blog + paper |
| **Personal** | "I noticed X while using my own tool." The visceral moment. | LinkedIn |

For each opportunity, extract:
- **Title**: Punchy, specific, non-generic. "Every AI Framework Has Memory. None of Them Learn." not "My Thoughts on AI Memory."
- **Source material**: Which PRs, issues, code files, buildlog entries, and commits provide the raw material
- **Links**: Full GitHub URLs to PRs, issues, and relevant code paths
- **Buildlog citation**: If sourced from a buildlog entry, include `buildlog://{repo}/{slug}` reference
- **Series**: Does this belong to a multi-part arc? Which one?
- **Channel**: LinkedIn (300-400 words), Blog (1000-3000 words), Substack (800-2000 words), or HN submission
- **Dependencies**: Does this need data/results that don't exist yet? Or can it be written now?

### Step 5: Check Existing Plan

Before generating output, check if a content plan already exists:

```bash
ls "${VAULT}/Writing/"
```

If `Content-Plan.kanban.md` or `Content-Briefs/` already exist, UPDATE them rather than overwriting. Append new opportunities, mark completed items, adjust priorities.

### Step 6: Generate Obsidian Output

Generate TWO outputs:

#### Output A: Kanban Board

Write to: `{vault}/Writing/Content-Plan.kanban.md`

Format (Obsidian Kanban plugin compatible):

```markdown
---
kanban-plugin: basic
---

## Backlog

- [ ] **Title of content piece** #series-name #channel-linkedin
  Source: [PR #62](https://github.com/Peleke/qortex/pull/62)
  Buildlog: `buildlog://buildlog-template/rule-level-attribution`
  Brief: [[Content-Briefs/title-slug]]

## Drafting

- [ ] **Title** #series-name #channel-blog

## Review

- [ ] **Title** #channel-substack

## Published

- [x] **Title** #channel-linkedin
  Published: 2026-02-10
```

Rules for the kanban:
- New items go in **Backlog** unless the user says otherwise
- Items that can be written RIGHT NOW (all source material exists) get a `#ready` tag
- Items that need future data/results get a `#blocked` tag with a note saying what's needed
- Use Obsidian tags: `#series-memory-gap`, `#series-building-in-public`, `#series-security`, `#series-learning-layer`, `#channel-linkedin`, `#channel-blog`, `#channel-substack`
- Link to the detailed brief via `[[Content-Briefs/slug]]`
- For fan-out items, group them: same buildlog source → consecutive kanban items with shared source reference

#### Output B: Content Briefs

Write individual brief files to: `{vault}/Writing/Content-Briefs/{slug}.md`

Format for each brief:

```markdown
---
type: content-brief
status: backlog
series: "The Memory Gap"
channel: linkedin, blog
estimated_words: 1500
created: 2026-02-08
ready: true
source_buildlog: "buildlog-template/workflow-enforcement-tiers-1-2"
source_prs: ["buildlog#125"]
fanout_from: "buildlog://buildlog-template/workflow-enforcement-tiers-1-2"
fanout_type: "architecture"
---

# Title of the Piece

## Angle
One sentence: what's the provocation or insight?

## Source Material
- PR: [buildlog#125 — workflow enforcement](https://github.com/Peleke/buildlog-template/pull/125)
- Buildlog: `buildlog/2026-02-06-workflow-enforcement-tiers-1-2.md` (1025 words, deep)
- Code: `src/buildlog/workflow.py` — verify_workflow(), install_hooks()
- Metadata: 10 review learnings, 10 promoted skills from this repo

## Key Points
1. Point one
2. Point two
3. Point three

## Opening Hook
Draft of the first 1-2 sentences. Make it stop-scrolling worthy.

## Series Context
Where this fits in the series arc. What comes before/after.

## Channel Adaptations
- **LinkedIn** (300 words): Focus on [X]. End with [Y].
- **Blog** (1500 words): Full technical depth. Include [Z].

## Dependencies
- [ ] Need: 10+ buildlog experiment sessions for data
- [x] Have: Framework gap analysis completed
- [x] Have: qortex architecture shipped
```

### Step 7: Suggest Schedule

After generating the kanban and briefs, propose a 2-week schedule:

```markdown
## Suggested Schedule

| Date | Channel | Piece | Source | Status |
|------|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| Mon Feb 10 | LinkedIn | "Title" | buildlog://repo/slug | Ready |
| Wed Feb 12 | LinkedIn | "Title" | PR #X | Ready |
| Fri Feb 14 | Blog | "Title" (Series 1.1) | buildlog://repo/slug | Ready |
| Mon Feb 17 | LinkedIn | "Title" | — | Blocked — needs X |
```

Prioritize:
1. Items tagged `#ready` (can write now, all source material exists)
2. Provocations first (audience-building), then architecture, then results
3. LinkedIn 2x/week, blog/Substack 1x/week
4. Don't schedule blocked items — list them separately as "upcoming when ready"
5. Fan-out items from the same buildlog entry should be spaced out (don't publish 3 pieces from the same entry in one week)

## Quality Gates

Apply these to every content opportunity before including it:

- **Specific**: Not generic advice. Concrete observation from real engineering work.
- **Non-obvious**: Challenges assumptions. "Everyone thinks X, but actually Y because we measured."
- **Instrumented**: Every piece traces to specific PRs, issues, buildlog entries, or code. No hand-waving.
- **Publish-either-way**: If the result is negative, the failure is publishable too.

## Obsidian Vault Path

The vault is at:
```
${VAULT}
```

Content plan goes in `Writing/`. Briefs go in `Writing/Content-Briefs/`.

This vault syncs via iCloud to the user's phone and is watched by Cadence (openclaw's ambient signal bus), so anything written here is immediately visible on mobile and detectable by the agent.

## Related Skills

This skill is part of a pipeline. Other skills in the content/publishing flow:

| Skill | Status | What It Does |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `signal-scan` | Done | Scan market signals, Reddit, HN for positioning |
| `decision-log` | Manual | Log strategic decisions to Obsidian |
| `persona-extract` | In progress | Extract named audience archetypes with real quotes |
| `offer-scope` | TODO | Map insights → offers per persona |
| `hunter-log` | Design done | Track outreach + lead engagement |
| `content-planner` | This skill | Engineering → content pipeline |

The P1 PR-Firm pipeline (openclaw) will eventually automate: `buildlog capture → content-planner scan → draft generation → approval → publish`. This skill is the human-in-the-loop version of that pipeline.
