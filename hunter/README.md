## The Problem

Most "AI agent" tools automate fragments. Summarize a doc. Draft an email. Generate a landing page. None of them do the full loop: spot an opportunity in the wild, validate it against real evidence, understand who actually hurts, scope what to build, generate every launch asset, and track whether it worked.

Hunter Pipeline does the full loop. Six core skills, chained through a typed envelope contract, writing structured output to an Obsidian vault that doubles as a queryable database. Every claim traced to evidence. Every decision logged with kill criteria. Every asset deployable from the vault.

## The Pipeline

<p align="center">
  <img src="public/pipeline-diagram.svg" alt="Hunter Pipeline Diagram" width="960"/>
</p>

Each stage consumes the output of the previous stage via a typed `PipelineEnvelope`. Every skill reads `_conventions.md` before executing, ensuring consistent vault paths, frontmatter schemas, and cross-reference syntax across the entire pipeline.

## Architecture

### PipelineEnvelope

Every skill wraps its output in a typed envelope:

```json
{
  "skill": "signal-scan",
  "version": "1.0",
  "session_id": "session-2026-03-06-001",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-06T14:30:00Z",
  "input_refs": ["upstream-artifact-id"],
  "output": { }
}
```

### Vault-as-Database

The Obsidian vault is structured as a queryable database:

```
Admin/Product-Discovery/
├── Pipeline.kanban.md          # Master board: 7 columns
├── _index.md                   # Dataview queries
├── Signal-Scans/               # signal-scan output
├── Decisions/                  # decision-log output
├── Personas/                   # persona-extract output
├── SWOT/                       # swot-analysis output
├── Offers/                     # offer-scope output
├── Pitches/                    # pitch output + launch kanbans
├── Sessions/                   # session logs
└── Pipeline.md                 # Product tracker table
```

- **Folders** = tables
- **Frontmatter** = schema (type, date, status, tags, refs)
- **Wikilinks** = foreign keys
- **Dataview** = SQL
- **Kanban boards** = status columns

### Configuration

Pipeline paths and defaults are configured in `.hunter-config.yaml` at the repo root. Skills resolve paths from this config, falling back to `_conventions.md` defaults.

## Eval Framework

Four-level evaluation system (7b-e) for pipeline quality assurance:

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│  7b: Input  │───▶│ 7c: Output  │───▶│7d: Pipeline │───▶│ 7e: Quality │
│  Validation │    │ Conformance │    │ Integration │    │  Scoring    │
│             │    │             │    │             │    │             │
│  Bad inputs │    │  Schema     │    │ Full chain  │    │ LLM-as-     │
│  rejected?  │    │  valid?     │    │ connected?  │    │ judge       │
│             │    │             │    │             │    │             │
│  Haiku      │    │  Haiku      │    │  Sonnet     │    │  Opus       │
│  Every PR   │    │  Every PR   │    │  Release    │    │  Release    │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
```

| Level | What | Pass Criteria | Cost | Frequency |
|-------|------|--------------|------|-----------|
| **7b** | Input validation | 100% rejection of bad envelopes | Low | Every PR |
| **7c** | Output conformance | 100% schema validation | Low | Every PR |
| **7d** | Pipeline integration | Full chain completes, refs connected | ~$10 | Release |
| **7e** | Quality scoring | Overall ≥7.0, no dimension <5.0 | ~$15 | Release |

See [`evals/README.md`](evals/README.md) for implementation details.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) with skills support
- An Obsidian vault (iCloud-synced recommended)
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) for pitch deployment

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Peleke/hunter.git
```

### Configure

Edit `.hunter-config.yaml` with your vault path:

```yaml
vault: ~/path/to/your/obsidian/vault
```

### Run the Pipeline

```
"Scan DevOps education for product signals"     → signal-scan
"Which opportunity should I pursue?"            → decision-log
"Extract personas for this opportunity"         → persona-extract
"Scope an offer for the top persona"            → offer-scope
"Build the launch kit"                          → pitch
```

Each skill chains automatically. Or run any skill standalone with the right trigger phrase.
